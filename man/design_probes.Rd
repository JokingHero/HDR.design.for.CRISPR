\title{Design Probes on a Sequence and Map them to Genomic Coordinates}
\usage{
design_probes(
  s,
  genomic_context,
  coordinate_map,
  variants_genomic,
  tmin = 59,
  tmax = 61,
  len_min = 20,
  len_max = 25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{A DNAString object representing the sequence to design probes on.}

\item{genomic_context}{A GRanges object of length 1 representing the original
genomic region from which \code{s} was derived.}

\item{coordinate_map}{A GRanges object created by \code{map_variants}, which describes
the relationship between coordinates on \code{s} and \code{genomic_context}.}

\item{variants_genomic}{A GRanges object of the variants that were injected to
create \code{s}. This is used by the mapping function to resolve probes that
fall entirely within a variant.}

\item{tmin}{The minimum desired melting temperature.}

\item{tmax}{The maximum desired melting temperature.}

\item{len_min}{The minimum probe length.}

\item{len_max}{The maximum probe length.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object of valid probes with genomic coordinates and metadata.
}
\description{
This function generates candidate probes on a given DNA sequence \code{s}, filters
them by melting temperature, and then uses a coordinate map to accurately
translate their positions back to the original genomic coordinates. This
approach correctly handles cases where \code{s} contains indels relative to the
original genomic sequence.
