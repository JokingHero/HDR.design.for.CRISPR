\title{Augment var_data with scoring and priority columns}
\usage{
augment_var_data_with_scores(
  var_data,
  optimization_scheme = "balanced",
  benign_cadd_threshold = 15,
  alphagenome_threshold = 0.99,
  splicing_count = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_data}{The main GRanges object of candidate SNPs.}

\item{optimization_scheme}{The optimization scheme for selecting synonymous SNPs. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"balanced"}: (Default) Balances safety, PAM disruption, and SNP quality.
\item \code{"safety_first"}: Prioritizes avoiding non-coding overlaps and using known benign SNPs.
\item \code{"disruption_first"}: Prioritizes PAM disruption and guide disruption.
}}

\item{benign_cadd_threshold}{Numeric. CADD score below which a variant is
considered high-confidence benign. Default 15.}

\item{alphagenome_threshold}{This is the threshold used to decide if a given splicing
prediction is not considered safe when above it}

\item{splicing_count}{This is the number of splicing predictors that have to be above the
\code{alphagenome_threshold} to consider a SNV as unsafe. Because we are using max
across all tissues and cell types we want to be sure an SNV is dangerous.}
}
\value{
The augmented var_data GRanges object with standardized columns:
\code{penalty_score}, \code{disruption_tier}, \code{safety_tier}, etc.
}
\description{
Pre-calculates standardized metrics on the var_data GRanges to
facilitate downstream sorting. Handles missing data (e.g., non-model organisms)
by imputing neutral defaults.
