\title{Get and Score Guides (Refactored)}
\usage{
get_guides_and_scores_refactored(
  variant_genomic,
  design_name,
  guide_distance,
  genome,
  score_efficiency = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variant_genomic}{A GRanges object of length 1 representing the variant.
Must have an 'ALT' metadata column.}

\item{design_name}{A character string for naming the design.}

\item{guide_distance}{An integer, the window size (in bp) on each side of the
variant to search for guides.}

\item{genome}{A BSgenome object for sequence retrieval.}

\item{score_efficiency}{A logical flag. If TRUE, calculate efficiency scores.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object containing all found guides, their sequences, scores
(for successfully run algorithms), and a final aggregated rank.
}
\description{
For a given genomic location, this function introduces a mutation,
designs potential CRISPR guides, and scores them for efficiency. It is designed
to be robust to failures in individual scoring algorithms.
