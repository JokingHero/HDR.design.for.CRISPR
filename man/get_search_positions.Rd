\title{Define Genomic Search Positions Relative to a Variant}
\usage{
get_search_positions(
  variant_genomic,
  allowed_positions_upstream,
  allowed_positions_downstream
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variant_genomic}{A GRanges object of length 1 representing the
central variant. The start and end coordinates are used as anchors.}

\item{allowed_positions_upstream}{A numeric vector of positive integers
indicating the distances to search upstream from the variant's start
position (e.g., \code{c(1, 5)} means 1bp and 5bp upstream).}

\item{allowed_positions_downstream}{A numeric vector of positive integers
indicating the distances to search downstream from the variant's end
position (e.g., \code{c(2, 10)} means 2bp and 10bp downstream).}
}
\value{
A sorted GRanges object containing all the specified genomic
positions, each with a width of 1. Returns an empty GRanges object if
no positions are specified.
}
\description{
This helper function calculates the absolute genomic coordinates for a set of
positions defined relatively (upstream and downstream) to a given variant.

The function operates on the reference genome's coordinate system. For
deletions, "upstream" is relative to the start of the deleted block and
"downstream" is relative to the end. For insertions, both are relative to
the single anchor base on the reference. The strand of the variant is ignored,
as positions are calculated on the genomic sequence.
